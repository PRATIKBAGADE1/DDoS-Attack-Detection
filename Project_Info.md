# PROJECT: Distributed Denial of Service Attacks in MySQL Database Project Based on Real-time Scenario

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a type of cyberattack where an attacker attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This is typically done by using a network of compromised devices (bots) to flood the targeted system with traffic, causing it to become overwhelmed and unable to handle legitimate requests.

## How a DDoS Attack Works

1. **Botnet creation**: An attacker creates a network of compromised devices (bots) by infecting them with malware.
2. **Traffic generation**: The attacker instructs the bots to send traffic to the targeted system, such as a website or network.
3. **Traffic flood**: The bots flood the targeted system with traffic, overwhelming its capacity to handle requests.
4. **System overload**: The targeted system becomes overwhelmed, causing it to slow down or become unavailable.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

1. **Volume-based attacks**: Overwhelming the targeted system with a large amount of traffic.
2. **Protocol attacks**: Exploiting weaknesses in network protocols to consume system resources.
3. **Application attacks**: Targeting specific applications or services to consume resources.

## Techniques Used in DDoS Attacks

1. **Botnets**: Networks of compromised devices used to launch attacks.
2. **Malware**: Software designed to harm or exploit systems.
3. **Scripting**: Using scripts to automate attack processes.
4. **Amplification attacks**: Using third-party services to amplify traffic.

## Protection Against DDoS Attacks

Organizations can use the following measures to protect against DDoS attacks:

1. **Firewalls**: To block malicious traffic.
2. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: To detect and prevent attacks.
3. **Load balancing**: To distribute traffic across multiple resources.
4. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: To cache content and reduce server load.
5. **DDoS mitigation services**: Specialized services to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.
